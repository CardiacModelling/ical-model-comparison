# This is a comment.  Comments in a protocol file start with a hash character "#" and continue
# until the end of a line.

# Most of a protocol file is comprised of blocks, which start with the name of the block, then
# an opening curly brace "{", and end at the matching closing curly brace "}".

# The order in which blocks appear matters; it is intended to reflect the natural flow of both
# writing and executing a protocol.  Each block is optional, and may be omitted if not needed
# for your protocol.  Indeed, the only blocks that appear in this file are "documentation" and
# "import".

# The first block that may appear is for documenting the protocol.  The documentation block for
# this protocol is below.
# The documentation is written using Markdown, and rendered nicely when viewing a protocol
# description on the Web Lab.  You can find a reference manual for Markdown's syntax at
# http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax and a live editor for trying it out at

# Steady State action potential evaluation

This protocol implements steady pacing for cardiac electrophysiology cell models, and produces
the action potential at 1Hz. Note that it is a really simple (4 line) protocol definition, that 
just imports SteadyStateRunner.txt and sets two of its inputs.

The imported protocol repeatedly paces the cell until the state variables are (approximately)
unchanging from beat to beat (or a maximum number of paces is reached).  We set each iteration
to consist of 2 paces, so that steady alternans can be detected.
}

# The protocol import below essentially makes this protocol behave like the one imported,
# except that some of its inputs are changed.

import "SteadyStateRunner.txt" {
    pacing_period = 1000  # ms
    num_inner_paces = 2   # How many paces to run between comparing state variables
}
