# Kinetic protocols
This repository contains the plots for the voltage-dependent activation, inactivation, and recovery from inactivation of L-type calcium current.

- [Figure 7](https://github.com/CardiacModelling/ical-review/blob/master/Data_Analysis/Kinetic_protocols/figure7.pdf) shows the activation protocol, raw current recorded in each sweep, and the normalised peak current against the step-voltage. A real time recording and sweep-wise post-processing of the current is shown in the [activation video](https://github.com/CardiacModelling/ical-review/blob/master/Data_Analysis/Kinetic_protocols/activation.mp4).
- [Figure 9](https://github.com/CardiacModelling/ical-review/blob/master/Data_Analysis/Kinetic_protocols/figure9.pdf) shows the inactivation protocol, raw current recorded in each sweep, and the normalised peak current against the step-voltage. A real time recording and sweep-wise post-processing of the current is shown in the [inactivation video](https://github.com/CardiacModelling/ical-review/blob/master/Data_Analysis/Kinetic_protocols/inactivation.mp4).
- [Figure 10](https://github.com/CardiacModelling/ical-review/blob/master/Data_Analysis/Kinetic_protocols/figure10.pdf) shows the recovery from inactivation protocol, raw current recorded in each sweep, and the normalised peak current against the time interval between pulses. A real time recording and sweep-wise post-processing of the current is shown in the [recovery from inactivation video](https://github.com/CardiacModelling/ical-review/blob/master/Data_Analysis/Kinetic_protocols/recovery.mp4).
